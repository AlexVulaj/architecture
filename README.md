# HyperFleet Architecture Repository

**Status**: Active  
**Owner**: Architecture Team  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22  

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as the **single source of truth** for all architectural documentation related to HyperFleet. All documents are **living documents** that evolve as the design and implementation progress.

**Key Principle**: All significant architectural decisions must be documented here with their trade-offs to track technical debt and enable informed future decisions.

---

## Repository Access & MVP Process

**Current Phase**: MVP Development

**Access & Permissions**:
- All developers in the HyperFleet team are granted **write access** to this repository
- To support quick iteration during MVP, developers have **approve and merge access** if there are no objections from peers
- This temporary process enables rapid documentation of decisions and scope changes

**Repository Usage**:
- This repository primarily records:
  - Architectural decisions and their rationale
  - Trade-offs we're accepting during MVP
  - Changes to MVP scope and priorities
  - Technical debt we're consciously incurring

**Post-MVP**:
- Once MVP is complete, we will establish official processes for:
  - Repository access management
  - PR review requirements
  - Approval workflows
  - Documentation governance

**During MVP, prioritize speed over process while maintaining clear documentation of decisions.**

---

### 2. Component Design Documents (`components/`)

**Purpose**: Detailed design for individual components

**Required Sections**:
- **What**: Component purpose and responsibilities
- **Why**: Problem it solves and context
- **How**: Technical implementation approach
- **Trade-offs**: What we gain vs what we lose (REQUIRED)
- **Dependencies**: What this component relies on
- **Interfaces**: APIs, events, data contracts
- **Configuration**: How to configure the component
- **Alternatives Considered**: What we didn't choose and why

**When to create**: New component introduction, major component redesign

**Living Document**: Update as component design evolves during implementation

---

### 3. Implementation Guides (`docs/`)

**Purpose**: Practical guides for developers and operators

**Contents**:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples and patterns
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting tips
- Best practices

**When to create**: New feature implementation, operational procedures

**Living Document**: Keep examples current as APIs and configurations change

---

## Tracking Trade-offs and Technical Debt

**Critical Requirement**: Every component design document MUST include both:
1. **"Trade-offs" section** - What we gain and lose with the chosen approach
2. **"Alternatives Considered" section** - What other options existed and why we didn't choose them

These sections work together to provide full context for architectural decisions.

### Trade-offs Template

```markdown
## Trade-offs

### What We Gain
- ✅ Benefit 1 with measurable impact
- ✅ Benefit 2 with context
- ✅ Benefit 3

### What We Lose / What Gets Harder
- ❌ Cost 1 - Technical debt we're accepting
- ❌ Cost 2 - Capability we're giving up
- ⚠️ Risk 1 - What could go wrong

### Technical Debt Incurred
- **Debt Item 1**: Description of shortcut taken, impact, remediation plan
- **Debt Item 2**: What we should fix in the future

### Acceptable Because
- Reason 1 why the trade-off makes sense
- Reason 2 (e.g., time constraints, simplicity, MVP scope)
```

### Example: Sentinel Direct Broker Publishing

```markdown
## Trade-offs

### What We Gain
- ✅ Simpler architecture (5 components vs 6)
- ✅ Lower latency (no outbox polling)
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain

### What We Lose / What Gets Harder
- ❌ Eventual consistency (not guaranteed delivery like outbox pattern)
- ❌ No transactional event creation with database writes
- ⚠️ Risk of events lost if broker is down and Sentinel crashes

### Technical Debt Incurred
- **No event delivery guarantees**: If Sentinel publishes to broker and crashes before updating internal state, we may duplicate events
  - **Impact**: Low (adapters are idempotent)
  - **Remediation**: Post-MVP, add event deduplication in adapters or message broker

### Acceptable Because
- MVP scope prioritizes simplicity over perfect consistency
- Cluster provisioning use case tolerates eventual consistency
- Adapters are designed to be idempotent
```

## Living Documents

All documents in this repository are **living documents**:

- **Update freely** as design evolves
- **Mark status** to indicate maturity (Draft, Active, Deprecated)
- **Track changes** via git commit history
- **Pay down debt** by updating "Technical Debt Incurred" sections

### Document Status

- **Draft**: Initial design, still being refined
- **Active**: Current implementation
- **Deprecated**: No longer used (link to replacement)

### Updating Documents

**When to update "Last Updated" date:**

Update the date for **meaningful changes only**:
- ✅ Component design changes
- ✅ New sections added
- ✅ Trade-offs modified
- ✅ Status changes (Draft → Active, Active → Deprecated)
- ✅ Technical debt paid down or added
- ❌ NOT for typos, formatting, or minor clarifications

**Note**: Git commit history tracks all changes. The "Last Updated" date is a quick visual indicator of the last **significant** revision.

**Steps for meaningful updates:**
1. Update the relevant sections
2. Update "Last Updated" date at the top of the document
3. If paying down technical debt, ~~strikethrough~~ the debt item and link to PR

Example of paying down technical debt:
```markdown
### Technical Debt Incurred
- ~~**No retry logic**: Adapters don't retry failed operations~~
  - **Status**: Resolved in #123
  - **Resolution**: Added exponential backoff retry logic
```

### Review and Merge Process

**MVP Process (Current)**:
- All HyperFleet team developers have approve and merge access
- You may approve and merge your own PR if:
  - No objections from peers within reasonable time (~4 hours during work hours)
  - You've posted the PR in Slack (#forum-hyperfleet) for visibility
  - The change is well-documented with clear rationale
- For major architectural changes, consider waiting for at least one peer review
- **Goal**: Move fast while keeping the team informed

**How to submit changes:**
1. Create a PR with your documentation updates
2. Add a clear description of what changed and why
3. Post the PR link in Slack: #hcm-hyperfleet-team
4. Wait 24 hours(time zone differences between regions) for objections during work hours (or use judgment for urgency). 
5. Once approve got from the peers and no other objections, it's OK to merge

**Post-MVP Process** (to be established):
- Formal approval requirements based on change type
- Required reviewers for different document categories
- Defined merge timelines and escalation paths

## Navigation Guide

### I want to...

**Understand HyperFleet architecture**
→ Start with `hyperfleet/architecture/architecture-summary.md`

**Design a new component**
→ Add document to `hyperfleet/components/` with required sections (see "Component Design Documents")

**Write an implementation guide**
→ Add guide to `hyperfleet/docs/` with step-by-step instructions

**Find trade-offs for a component**
→ Read component document in `hyperfleet/components/`, look for "Trade-offs" section

**Track technical debt**
→ Search all component docs for "Technical Debt Incurred"

---

## Writing Guidelines

### Trade-offs and Alternatives Are Required

Every component document MUST document both trade-offs AND alternatives considered. These go hand-in-hand:
- **Trade-offs** explain what you gain and lose with your chosen approach
- **Alternatives** explain what other options you considered and why you rejected them

Without alternatives, trade-offs lack context. Why did you accept this trade-off? What were you comparing against?

### Be Specific

❌ Bad: "This makes things faster"
✅ Good: "This reduces API latency from 200ms to 50ms"

### Quantify Impact

❌ Bad: "This improves performance"
✅ Good: "This reduces memory usage by 40%"

### Document Trade-offs Honestly

❌ Bad: "This is better in every way"
✅ Good: "This simplifies code but increases latency by 10ms"

### Include Diagrams

All architecture and component documents should include Mermaid diagrams.

---

## Diagram Guidelines

### Use Mermaid for Diagrams

All diagrams should use Mermaid syntax for:
- Maintainability (text-based, version control friendly)
- GitHub rendering (renders in markdown)
- Consistency

---

## Quality Standards

### Component Design Documents Must Have

- [ ] Clear "What" section (component purpose)
- [ ] "Why" section (problem context)
- [ ] "How" section (implementation approach)
- [ ] **"Trade-offs" section** (what we gain vs lose) - REQUIRED
- [ ] **"Alternatives Considered" section** - REQUIRED (trade-offs only exist because you chose one approach over alternatives)
- [ ] Dependencies clearly listed
- [ ] Interfaces documented (APIs, events)
- [ ] Configuration examples
- [ ] At least one diagram

**Note**: Trade-offs and Alternatives go hand-in-hand. If you document trade-offs, you MUST document what alternatives you considered and why you didn't choose them.

### Guides Must Have

- [ ] Clear target audience
- [ ] Step-by-step instructions
- [ ] Code/configuration examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting section
- [ ] Links to related documents

## Searching for Technical Debt

Use these commands to find technical debt across documents:

```bash
# Find all technical debt items
grep -r "Technical Debt" hyperfleet/components/

# Find all trade-offs
grep -r "## Trade-offs" hyperfleet/

# Find all "What We Lose" sections
grep -r "What We Lose" hyperfleet/

# Find deprecated documents
grep -r "Status: Deprecated" hyperfleet/
```

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to document every implementation detail?**
A: No. Focus on architectural decisions and component design. Implementation details belong in code comments and inline documentation.

**Q: What if I don't know the trade-offs yet?**
A: Document what you know and mark unknowns:
- "⚠️ Unknown: Performance impact needs measurement"
- "⚠️ To investigate: Scalability limits"

Update the document as you learn more.

**Q: How detailed should component docs be?**
A: Detailed enough that someone unfamiliar with the component can:
- Understand its purpose
- Understand the trade-offs
- Start implementing or operating it

Avoid implementation minutiae (that's for code comments).

**Q: Can I update someone else's document?**
A: Yes! These are living documents. Update freely as design evolves. Use git history to track changes.

**Q: When should I create a new document vs update existing?**
A: Update existing documents when:
- Refining the existing design
- Adding implementation details
- Paying down technical debt
- Fixing errors or clarifications

Create new documents when:
- Adding a completely new component
- Major redesign that deprecates old approach
- New feature guide or operational procedure
